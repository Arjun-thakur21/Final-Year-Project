# Bearing Fault Diagnosis Project

## Overview
This project is designed for deep learning-based bearing fault diagnosis. It aims to provide a framework for analyzing and diagnosing faults in bearings using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `bearing_fault_diagnosis/`: The main application directory containing the core files.
  - `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - `settings.py`: Configuration settings for the Django project.
  - `urls.py`: URL routing for the application.
  - `wsgi.py`: Entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers.
  - `asgi.py`: Entry point for ASGI-compatible web servers.
- `manage.py`: Command-line utility for interacting with the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bearing-fault-diagnosis
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.
- Modify the `settings.py` file to configure your database and other settings as needed.
- Use the `urls.py` file to define your application's URL patterns and views.
